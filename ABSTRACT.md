The author of the **Wind Turbine Detection** dataset primarily sourced the majority of images from the [Power Plant Satellite Imagery Dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/Power_Plant_Satellite_Imagery_Dataset/5307364). Subsequently, they engaged in manual labeling of the images and converted them into properly formatted labels, which are also included in the folder named original_images_and_labels. After this data preparation, they performed preprocessing to generate smaller images with dimensions of 608x608 pixels, along with their corresponding labels formatted in YOLOv3 format, including class, x, y, height, and width. The values for x, y, height, and width are relative and range from 0 to 1, proportionally scaled to the size of the images. This dataset comprises these smaller images and labels, with image resolutions varying between 0.6-1m.

The original Power Plant Satellite Imagery Dataset contains satellite imagery of 4,454 power plants within the United States. The imagery is provided at two resolutions: 1m (4-band NAIP iamgery with near-infrared) and 30m (Landsat 8, pansharpened to 15m). The NAIP imagery is available for the U.S. and Landsat 8 is available globally. This dataset may be of value for computer vision work, machine learning, as well as energy and environmental analyses.

The dataset consists of 1742 images with 3889 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*wind turbine*).

Images in the Wind Turbine Detection (by Saurabh Shahane) dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 457 (26% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The original dataset was released in 2020.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
